My name is Caleb Neff
  I am pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Engineering. 
  I would like to begin working on developing my own mods for Minecraft and learn how to create mods in Terraria. 
  For Minecraft I would like to create a mod that can make Applied Energistics and Astral Sourcery work together. There would be special items that allow the a storage system store astral energy.
  For Terraria I would like to learn how to create a mod, the mod would be simple but I would like to at least add in a few new items.
